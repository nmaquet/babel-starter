# Minimal Babel Starter :rocket:

Get started writing ES6 with an understandable, minimal configuration.

You can find information about this configuration over at this
[tutorial series](https://github.com/AriaFallah/WebpackTutorial).

In the interest of being minimal, this excludes unessential things seen in the tutorial such as the `css-loader`,
and the `html-webpack-plugin`.

## Contributing

I will gladly accept any and all contributions/corrections. If you have any questions,
feel free to leave them as issues. If I made mistakes, please point them out. Finally, if you feel
that I left anything out or this config can be made better, make sure to leave an issue or
make a pull request.
