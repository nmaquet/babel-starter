# Minimal Babel Starter :rocket:

Get started writing ES6 with an understandable, minimal configuration.

If you have trouble understanding the configuration, check out some tutorials I wrote on
webpack [here](https://github.com/AriaFallah/WebpackTutorial/tree/master/part1)
and [here](https://github.com/AriaFallah/WebpackTutorial/tree/master/part2)

## Contributing

I will gladly accept any and all contributions/corrections. If you have any questions,
feel free to leave them as issues. If I made mistakes, please point them out. Finally, if you feel
that I left anything out or this config can be made better, make sure to leave an issue or
make a pull request.
