# Minimal Babel Starter :rocket:

Get started writing ES6 with an understandable, minimal configuration.

You can find information about this configuration over at this
[tutorial series](https://github.com/AriaFallah/WebpackTutorial).

In the interest of being minimal this excludes things seen in the tutorial such as the `css-loader`,
and the `html-webpack-plugin`.
